# DTM_Automation
This project automates the task of manually inputting info on the Debris Transport Manifests (In portuguese, MTR - Manifesto de Transporte de Res√≠duos, but we'll use DTM), a licensed government system made for monitoring and keeping tabs on Senders, Transporters, and Receivers involved in construction produced materials.
